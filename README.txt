JULIEN ROUGERIE FINAL ASSINGMENT 3005

databasesource: server/DiabloTwo.db
Background
This project is motivated by the mechanic of Magic Find in the game Diablo 2 (the resurrected edition to be specific). In Diablo2, player find new items by defeating enemies and each enemy can give the player most to all items in the game. However, while every item can drop from every enemy, most of the desirable items are still incredibly rare. As items also carry a property known as drop chance, which is the chance an enemy character has of dropping the specific item. While most of these drop chance values are low, players can better their chances by applying certain strategies. In specific, moving to a higher difficulty setting, using items which boost their “magic find” property and targeting specific enemies who have higher chances to give certain items. Thus, to minimize the amount of time it takes to play for an item, many turns to magic find calculators. The database can be used to find what enemies are best to farm (defeat in mass repetition) for certain items while being able to factor in difficulty and the players magic find level.
APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
The following describe what is required from the application 
R1.1) Provide an indexing database that takes in data from a Datbase of Diablo2 items. Getting the information of all enemies,chests and items in the game.
R1.2) Offer some form of UI so that a user can search for items and their drop chance. 
R1.3) In addition to 1.2, also provide an area where the user can check which difficulty they wish to farm on as well and apply the change in drops to the database.
R1.4) Allow the user to search for enemies and see their drops.
R1.5) Allow for users to search for items and see the enemies who can drop said item.
R1.6) Allow the user to search for items via the chest which drop the specific items
R1.7) Allow the user to search for chest and see what they can drop 
R1.6) The target size of the database would contain all the bosses of the Diablo acts so 5 (Andairal,Duriel,Mephisto,Diablo,Baal), several items of varying value (estimated at 26 individual items), and 5 chest (for each act). As well, the database must contain all entries of Items and their specfic chest (around 200 relations)
R1.8) the application should allow any user regardless of knowledge of diablo to be able to search for any item/enemy/chest in the database. The user interface should contain the easiest of information capable for searching for specific items.
R1.8) Application should be web-based with user interaction through any popular browser (e.g. chrome, Firefox, edge, Opera)
Due Diligence 
Since this Database contains information, which is currently under copyright of Activision Blizzard, it is still my belief that we are not in violation of copyright in making such a database public. Specifically:
CPY1.1:Blizzard’s official stance regarding public databases has been one of support. Including offering public API’s for some of their games.
CPY2 1.2: Even if Blizzard does not provide the data themselves, there is already a full public API available online via diablo2.io.

Since this Database contains information, which is currently under copyright of Activision Blizzard, it is still my belief that we are not in violation of copyright in making such a database public. Specifically:
CPY1.1:Because it's not the acutal Database, rather it is one I made consisting of several items and monsters in the game
